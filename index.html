  <p class="May 6">finally fumbled my way to a solution that had been eluding me for a while: successfully setting up a way to share files back and forth between my shabby, refurbished, physical Windows host computer and my somehow-better-performing-with-a-quarter-of-the-resources virtual Ubuntu guest machine, after lots of swearing and re-googling protocol errors. That'll allow me to move images and other media files from my main computer storage to this programming platform, so that I can put them in the necessary directories for this all to run together. Hopefully. <br> 
  	played another mission in the Zerg campaign for Starcraft 1. For whatever reason, I never picked the game up as a kid, when it was wildly popular. Dunno why; I spent a lot of time playing Blizzard's other big RTS, Warcraft 3. But while living here in South Korea, where SC was once known unironically as the national sport, I decided to give it a try. And what do you know? I'm enjoying it! </p>
